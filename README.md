# ACCT604Project

The project replicated a paper titled "Detecting Accounting Fraud in Publicly Traded U.S. Firms Using a Machine Learning Approach". In addition, we ran additional machine learning models and tested on two additional variables: credit ratings and changes in credit ratings. 

The data was sourced from the paper's GitHub repository (https://github.com/JarFraud/FraudDetection/blob/master/data_FraudDetection_JAR2020.csv). In order to decipher the company names, we used Compustat Daily Updates-Ratings' database in order to find the company name, credit rating information, and additional information on the companies from the "gvkey" (https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/get-data/compustat-capital-iq-standard-poors/compustat/north-america-daily/ratings/).
